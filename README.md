# Config

My dotfiles.

## Installation

To install the configuration for applications, run:

```console
$ ./install.sh common
```

And to install the configuration for the desktop, run:

```console
$ ./install.sh common
```

The script will tell what commands are missing and need to be installed for the config to work properly.
